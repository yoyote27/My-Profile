					<p>
					I have never stopped doing sport in my life.
					As soon as I was old enough to do so, I joined an artistic gymnastics club.
					I did it in competition for almost 5 years.
					Then I stopped and did one year of athletics and one year of krav maga, an Israeli martial art.
					These last sports did not suit me, so I decided to join a handball club.
					I've been doing it for 6 years and I don't intend to stop! I love the fact that in this sport no match is the same.
					Moreover, the fact that I play in a team pushes me to give my all and to go beyond my limits.

				<h2>Travel</h2> <!-- Insértion du titre de mon paragraphe -->

					<p>
					I love to travel, in fact, I think that this activity allows you to learn many things.
					You discover new places, new cultures, new people.
					This activity pushes us to leave our comfort zone.
					Indeed, we leave in an unknown country where we have no reference.
					You also learn about yourself.
					You discover aspects of your personality that you didn't even think you had, such as your ability to persevere and adapt.
					I have already visited a Greek island called Rhodes.
					I have also been to Algiers, London, Barcelona, Madrid, Pompeii, Sicily and the Dominican Republic.

				<h2>Cooking</h2> <!-- Insértion du titre de mon paragraphe -->

					<p>
					I always saw my mother cooking, and it was she who passed on this passion to me.
					I remember when I was a little girl I used to help her stir the cake batter or knead the pie dough.
					Today I don't only cook desserts but also dishes.	
					I like the idea that I can turn simple ingredients like flour, eggs, peppers into something good like cakes and pizzas.
					One of the things that cooking does for me is to relax.
